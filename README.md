# StudyHub

Welcome to StudyHub, here are some main features of our project:

## `Home (Login/Signup) Page`
There is a button at the bottom of the home page to switch between Login and Signup page.
### `Login Page`
We have two types of user: admin and regular users.
The username and password for these two types of users are as follows:
- regular user:<br />
username: user <br />
password: user <br />
- admin user: <br />
username: admin <br />
password: admin <br />

### `Signup Page`
Currently the signup feature is unavaible since we need to store the user data.<br>
However, all fields required for signup have been displayed in the signup box.

## `Regular User`
Our primary focus is on regular user interaction in phase 1. <br />
We have developed the following view for regular users:

### `Navigation Bar`
In the Navagation Bar, a regular user can access the following view: <br />
Dashboard, Billboard, Ranking and Profile. <br />
A regular user can also logout by clicking the "Log Out" button on the rightside of the Navigation Bar.

### `Dashboard`
In th Dashboard, a regular user can access all courses he is currently taking and teaching. <br />
Only CSC309A is currently avaiable, but all like button functions correctly. <br />

A regular user can also enroll new courses by clicking the plus button on the top right corner. <br />
A following pop window will show, and a regular user can fill in course information, check the Terms&Conditions <br />
and finally sumbit his request to enroll a new course. The newly added course will show up in the dashboard.
