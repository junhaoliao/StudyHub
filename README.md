# StudyHub

Welcome to StudyHub, here are some main features of our project:

## `Login/Signup Page`
There is a button at the bottom of the home page to switch between Login and Signup page.
### `Login Page`
We have two types of user: admin and regular users.
The username and password for these two types of users are as follows:
- regular user:<br />
username: user <br />
password: user <br />
- admin user: <br />
username: admin <br />
password: admin <br />

### `Signup Page`
Currently the signup feature is unavaible since we need to store the user data.<br>
However, all fields required for signup have been displayed in the signup box.
